### :star2: Objective: <a name="objective"></a>
Create a responsive portfolio website that demonstrates my CSS skills and showcases some of my code projects. 

### :sparkles: Feature: <a name="feature"></a>
The image previews of the code examples are slightly transparent until you over over them. I included a gradient 'border' to help make the image pop out to the user's eyes.
